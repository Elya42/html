<body> <h1>The perfect croissant!</h1>
<img src="imeges/croissant.jpg"/>

<p>There is nothing quite like a warm, buttery, flaky croissant for breakfast that is freshly baked and straight from the oven.<br> With its origins dating back to the 13th century, croissants are still incredibly popular today and very accessible in local cafes,<br> restaurants and patisseries. Yet few of us realise the technical process, art and refined techniques which advanced pastry chefs<br> master in order to bring us these crispy, layered delights.<br>

<p>Whether you like your croissants filled, bi-coloured, iced, or you are an activated charcoal enthusiast who is partial to a black croissant,<br> one thing which we can all agree on is that the traditional croissant reigns supreme. <br>As croissants are so readily available and easy to eat, it may surprise you to learn that they are actually not so easy to make.<br>
 Croissants can take up to two full days to prepare and bake and with the technical process involved in getting them perfect. <br>It is no wonder they are not usually recommended for beginners to attempt without tuition.</p>

<ol>
<li><h4> Use a high protein bakerâ€™s flour</h4> 
Stoneground organic flour is recommended by chefs for the perfect croissants.

</li>
<li><h4> Check the quality of the butter</h4> 
Since one of the key ingredients in croissants is butter,<br> chefs recommend using a high quality butter which is 84-87% fat with no additives or extra water.
